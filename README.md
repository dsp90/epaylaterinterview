#I spent 12 hours on the coding problem. I would have created a better beautiful retrofit api architecture and beautiful exception handling.
I would add a beautiful ui for all three modules (balance, spending and transaction) and applied caching.


#My favourite framework would have been volley. I love the simplicity of it.

#I learnt code cleanliness and what I am looking forward to is making my own architectures for using network libraries and customviews.

#I would track down a performance problem through various tools such as android profiler and if in production then crashlytics.
Also spending time on using your application as a user day to day normally gives you a better insight of performance issues.

#I would create a whole new response base class for it so I would have to only recieve response in the activity and 
fragment part. Rest everything should be handled in the separate class for the particular endpoint.
